### Have you met anyone who loves developing integrations? *No.* That’s why we designed an easy developer experience that you’ll enjoy

- **Simple developer experience:** easy to self-host, uses industry-standard data models, and is extensible

### More than a devtool: Panora helps you put your product at the core of your customer's daily workflows

Your customers expect all of their tools to work well together. Panora avoids your team spending hundreds of hours building and maintaining integrations instead of your core product.
