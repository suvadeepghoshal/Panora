# Ensure 3rd party metadata is set

Look into the `packages/shared/src/connectors/metadata.ts` [file](https://github.com/panoratech/Panora/blob/main/packages/shared/src/connectors/metadata.ts) and check if the provider you want to build has its metadata set inside the `CONNECTORS_METADATA` object.

It should be available (if not [contact us](https://app.cal.com/rflih/30)) with `active` field set to `false` meaning the integration has not been built.
